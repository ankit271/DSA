## Stack :

A stack is a linear data structure that represents the sequence of elements in a program. Each element can be added to the top (called the last element) of the stack, and when an element is removed from the top, it's called popping.

A stack has two main operations: push and pop. Push adds an element to the top of the stack, while pop removes the top element. The order of these operations matters because if you push and then pop without considering the order, you might end up with incorrect data.

### Methods :
Operation | Description
|:--------|:-----------
push() | Adds an item to the top
pop() | Removes and returns the top item
peek() or top() | Returns the top item without removing it
isEmpty() | Checks if the stack is empty
size() | Returns the number of items in the stack
