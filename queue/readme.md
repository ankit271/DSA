A queue is a data structure that follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle, meaning elements are added at the back and removed from the front. 
The Standard Template Library (STL) provides a built-in queue class to make working with queues easier.

### Key Operations :

- push(x): Adds an element to the back of the queue.

- pop(): Removes the element at the front of the queue.

- front(): Accesses the front element.

- back(): Accesses the last element.

- empty(): Checks if the queue is empty.

- size(): Returns the number of elements in the queue.
